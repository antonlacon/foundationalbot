Core:
    Twitch API integration
        Commands:
            !uptime - show stream uptime
            !title - update title
            !game - set game
        Enhancement:
            Show whether raffle winner is follow / subscriber and how long
    Whispers (private messages)
        accept commands from there too
        send whispers too
        Needs to be whitelisted by Twitch for sending similar messages - antispam?
    Time Messages to channel
        Rolling timestamps:
            take a timestamp when bot joins channel
            add X minutes of delay for message - var for length in bot_cfg
            send randomized message - list of possible messages in bot_cfg
                follow? youtube? twitter?
            update timestamp to next message possibility
    Implement logging / debug / error message levels
        include timestamps
    Format raffle winner's name differently in log (color?)
Command Parser:
    Integrate user_mod_status in command parser
    Add a !reset command - clears channel strikes, raffle settings, multi settings?
SQL:
    Add a maintenance action where user is deleted from table if strikecount meets limit
    Teach argument parameters for calling directly:
        wipe viewer currency - add a bot command to cmd parser for this too/instead?
        wipe raffle status
        Reset all tables
        verbose debug info(?)
        Reindex & vacuum - necessary once persistent file db is used
