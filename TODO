Core:
    Twitch API integration
        Commands:
            !uptime - show stream uptime
            !title - update title
            !game - set game
        Enhancement:
            Show whether raffle winner is follow / subscriber and how long
    Whispers (private messages)
        accept commands from there too
        send whispers too
        Needs to be whitelisted by Twitch for sending similar messages - antispam?
    Time Messages to channel
        follow? youtube? twitter?
    Implement logging / debug / error message levels
        include timestamps
    Multichannel work
        Needs threading and queue work which requires classes
        Get !schedule to account for timezones or differences for each channel
        !join and !leave comamnds working correctly
        Adjust RECONNECT once irc_send_message accepts channel assignment
        Join Bot / admin's channel on login only
        Have bot track its Mod status in each channel
        Per channel stikes
        Adjust sleep to account for whether it had mod privileges for the message or not (sleep duration)
    Format raffle winner's name differently in log (color?)
    Try a sleep system using date to determine when next message / command is allowed?
        Utilize a command queue
Command Parser:
    Integrate user_mod_status in command parser
    Add a !reset command - clears channel strikes, raffle settings, multi settings?
SQL:
    Adjust table creation into one that includes channel data(?)
        Add limit to searches / queires / inserts where channel is taken into account
    Add a maintenance action where user is deleted from table if strikecount meets limit
    Teach argument parameters for calling directly:
        wipe viewer currency - add a bot command to cmd parser for this too/instead?
        wipe raffle status
        Reset all tables
        verbose debug info(?)
        Reindex & vacuum - necessary once persistent file db is used
